# Big-Parades
I was bored and wanted to find big parades in Northern Ireland.

Example:

Use args exclusively

`-t`: Prints top 10 Parades by Number of Bands

`-b`: Search by Band. (Fuzzy)

`python parades.py -b "Republican Crown Defenders"`

`-r`: Search by Road. (Fuzzy) (Outwards Route Only)

`python parades.py -r "Royal Avenue"`

Just prints results out. I suggest piping results into a file.
